# Granular-Calculator
Welcome to Granular Calc – a calculator with a mind of its own. Here, numbers aren’t always ready when you are: each digit needs time to “recharge” after being pressed. Click too quickly, and you’ll only get a fraction of its value; wait patiently, and the full number reveals itself.

Watch as buttons shrink, grow, and pulse in a dynamic, chaotic dance, turning a simple calculation into a game of timing and strategy. Whether you’re adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing, you’ll need patience, foresight, and maybe a little luck to master the granular flow of numbers.

Granular Calc isn’t just math—it’s an experience where numbers come alive, teaching you to respect their rhythm… or risk the chaos of partial sums.
